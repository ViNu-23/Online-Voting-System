# voting_system


This is a Voting System Project in PHP. The system was created using PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL Database, and Bootstrap for the design. The system is responsive which means you can manage the system using your mobile phone, laptop, tablet, or desktop computer. This system has 2 types of users which are the Admin and the voters. The Admin user is in charge of managing the list of candidates, organization, voters, and has access to the vote result. The Voters are the student who can vote in any organization and submit their votes. The system is user-friendly and nice user-interface using Bootstrap.
